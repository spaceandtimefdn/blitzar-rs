Updates given commitments using `curve25519` elements.

If the data input is either a slice view of a [crate::sequence::Sequence] or a slice view of a [curve25519_dalek::scalar::Scalar], then his function updates the `commitments` data according to::

```text
let partial_commitments = vec![CompressedRistretto::zero(); data.len()];

for i in 0..data.len() {
    for j in 0..data[i].len() {
        partial_commitments[i] = partial_commitments[i] +
            generators[j + offset_generators] * data[i][j];
    }
    commitments[i] = commitments[i] + partial_commitments[i];
}
```

The `partial_commitments` is computed by [compute_curve25519_commitments].

# Arguments

* `commitments` - A sliced view of a `CompressedRistretto` memory area where the 
               256-bit Ristretto point results will be written to. Please,
               you need to guarantee that this slice captures exactly
               `data.len()` element positions.

* `data` - A generic slice view `T`. Currently, we support
        two different types of slices. First, a slice view of a [crate::sequence::Sequence], 
        which captures the slices of contiguous u8 memory elements.
        In this case, you need to guarantee that the contiguous `u8` slice view
        captures the correct amount of bytes that can reflect
        your desired amount of `num_rows` in the sequence. After all,
        we infer the `num_rows` from `data[i].data_slice.len() / data[i].element_size`.
        The second accepted data input is a slice view of a [curve25519_dalek::scalar::Scalar] memory area,
        which captures the slices of contiguous Dalek Scalar elements.

* `offset_generators` - A value that is used to shift the get generator operation by
                        `offset_generators` values. With this shift, we have
                        `generator[0]` holding the value of `randomly_generate_curve25519_point(0 + offset)`,
                        `generator[1]` holding the value of `randomly_generate_curve25519_point(1 + offset)`,
                        and so on.

# Asserts

If the `data.len()` value is different from the `commitments.len()` value.

# Panics

If the compute `compute_curve25519_commitments` execution fails.
If the compute `compute_curve25519_commitments_with_generators` execution fails.
If the compute `get_curve25519_generators` execution in the GPU / CPU fails.
